       "\"Hi allHaving just returned from DLP I thought it might be useful to write a short idiots guide with some of the info I wish I'd known before I went.Firstly   getting there. We drove (going through the chunnel) so if you're flying we can't help you with this bit. Our Satnav got us there no problem and most people will have some form of access to a satnav these days. There are signs to DLP but they are few and far between so don't rely on them to guide you there. There is also a very good guide that we used to get us there. It's here under post number 9: https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g226865-i2224-k5776128/Driving-to-DLP-and-advise-please-Marne-la-Vallee-Seine-et MarneIle-de-France.html Be aware of the advice about 3 4 of the way down where you need to be in the fast lane to get to the right road   this is easy to miss and the French tend to drive nose to tail so changing lanes can be traumatic! There are guides to avoiding the toll on the A1 but, given what you're spending on the rest of the trip, I'd say it's not worth the hassle   it cost us   22 each way (yep, it's expensive).It goes without saying that you need the extra kit to drive on the French roads but these are readily available at Halfords and other car placesDAVEY CROCKETT RANCHWe stayed at the Davey Crockett ranch which, for us, turned out to be an excellent choice. I'll go over why that was in a moment. The ranch itself was perfect for our needs (be aware they wont let you in until 4pm on the day of arrival). We're 2 adults with a 6 and 9 year old. There were 2 separate rooms with an internal area which had a freezer, fridge, dishwasher, tv but no oven. The reason we went with Davey Crockett was the self catering option. We researched the meal plans beforehand and we thought they were really expensive   we also preferred to cook our own food as lots of the food on site was 'junk' food (chips burgers etc). Not saying that we don't like that but it's good to have a real meal in the day as well. The park states that there's to be no 'pique nique' in the grounds but everyone does it and they don't seem to stop anyone. This is a MAJOR benefit as the prices for food within the park are exorbitant (about   8 for a hotdog and chips etc). This may sound like we're being tight and grumpy but trust me   once you're in the queue for that   8 burger you'll be wincing too   we were very happy with our baguettes which we took with us each morning. Getting food: If you have room I'd recommend taking a lot of sundries with you if you're staying in Davey Crockett. Although reception gives you a guide to finding the big supermarket (Auchan) actually finding it for the first time (before you get familiar with the local roads) can be quite stressful. Again, your Satnav may guide you there no problem but it's worth having a meal ready to go on the first day to avoid trauma. Auchan itself is very well provisioned and has everything you'd need for your trip. We stocked up for the week in 1 shop and never had to go back.But what about the bread? Well there's the 'Park Natural' which is open to Davey Crockett ranch users whilst the pool is being renovated and that contains a great Boulangerie where we picked up our bread for the remainder of the trip. The advantage of this was it was just around the corner from the ranches and therefore much easier to find that Auchan.DISNEY HOTEL OR NOT DISNEY HOTELOK, so we can't comment on the other hotels and you know how we felt about our own. The main and overwhelming reason why you should go for a Disney hotel is the access to magic hour which is super super important to getting the most out of the parks. Basically you get access to the park from 08:30 when the general public get access from 10:00. This time is utterly precious for getting access to characters and the popular rides. If you're smart you can whizz through a lot of the rides that you'd spend hours queueing for later on within this time. Also, your kids are going to want to have their autograph books signed and this is by far the best time to do this (queues for the popular characters can easily be 2 hours plus once the park opens to the general public).AUTOGRAPH HUNTINGWhilst I'm on the subject   if you're looking for one of the princess autographs here's what you should do. Plan to be one of the first at the gate at 08:30 (which probably means getting there at 08:15 or so). Know where the princess meeting booth is (so you might want to do this on the first day and actually get the autograph on the second). Once the gate is opened leg it as fast as you can to the booth (you wont be the only one!!) and get as far up the queue as you can. We didn't do this ('cos we didn't know) and ended up spending from 08:30 to 11:00 in the queue (and you don't get to know which princess it's going to be!). There's precious little to see whilst you're queueing so make sure you have something to keep your little ones amused!There's also a trick to seeing Mickey. He's got his own special house in the main park where you can greet him which usually has brutal queues but he also appears in the Studio park in the morning (next to Aladdin's carpet ride). We only had to wait 30 mins to see him here. So if you manage to time it right this can be a great time saver. The CASTLE LIGHT UP EVENING SHOWDo this once. Seriously. It is worth seeing but the crowds are huge and getting out afterwards takes forever. Make sure you have good hold on young children and have a contingency plan for getting separated (even for them   the main bandstand for example). We did it mid week, I'd hate to think what it was like on a Saturday. Also, don't worry so much about getting prime position. We were somewhat to the side but still got to see everything and the castle was spectacular. The RIDESThis is something I wish we'd known before we got there as, if your time is limited, there's definitely some which you should prioritise. We were there for 4 days and it was only by day 4 that we had fully covered both parks.Here's a quick guide to some of the rides and what we thought of them (this is clearly subjective but I'll try to be as open as possible)I'll also only name rides you can't see inside.HYPERSPACE MOUNTAINThis is a full on rollercoaster in the dark with flashing light effects. The height limit is 1.2m but I'd urge caution in letting young children onto this (my daughter is just under 1.2m and I'm very glad she wasn't allowed on   she'd have been terrified). It's easily the most intense ride in the park so if you're looking for thrills   that's the one to go for.SPACE TOURSThis is a great family ride. Basically it's a simulator but it's very well done and suitable for all ages   my 6 year old loved it and she's never seen Star Wars!BUZZ LIGHYEARBasically you're on a track and you shoot targets using a light gun. It was alright but we went on when there was no queue and we didn't go on it again for the remainder of our stay.IT'S A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALLA boat ride through the countries of the world with dolls decked out in national gear. My kids loved it and it's fun for the parents to see the rather patronising view of each country. Its queue also moves really fast so it's worth doing for that alone. As an aside if you've ever played Portal 2 look up at the ceiling whilst you're on the ride   you'll get what I mean...PETER PANA great ride, well worth the queue time. You fly over London and Neverland. It's one of those rides that does a great job of making you feel you're part of a story   especially when you're flying through the stars.PINOCCHIO and SNOW WHITEBasically train rides with models at the side telling the story of the character. Could be scary for very young children. Not worth a huge wait.PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEANArgh! (not in a piratey way). The queue for this was an abomination and is longer than the ride itself. Only go on this one at off peak times. The ride itself is amazingly well done and keeps your attention but we only went on it once as we just couldn't face that queue again! It's suitable for everyone.INDIANA JONESA great fun rollercoaster with a 360 loop. This was one of my eldest daughter's (9) favourites. It's exciting but not terrifying. Again, this is one of the ones you can get onto multiple times if you go off peak.BIG THUNDER MOUNTAINThis was our family favourite rollercoaster. It has a brilliant mix of thrills and character (the ending was exhilarating each time even though you knew it was coming). This was my youngest daughter's (6) favourite ride in the park. The queues can be big so it's worth fast passing this one.STUDIOS PARK RIDESThis park shuts at 7 so you should plan for this when considering what rides to go on. If you time it right you can get on a lot of rides as the park tends to empty towards 7 as people migrate into the other park   we got on a lot of rides quickly this way.AEROSMITH COASTERFast, noisy and jarring. LIke Hyperspace mountain but not so much fun. Not suitable for young children and certainly not worth queueing for hours for. If I went again I'd skip this altogether.HAUNTED HOUSE and CRUSH COASTERThese were both shut for our visit so I can't commentTOWER OF TERRORAgain, we caught this at zero queue time. It's essentially a jumping bean style ride which takes you up and then drops you down. It's very well put together and is the best one of these type of rides I've been on   The ride itself contains ghostly images which may be scary and unsettling for young children (my 9 year old didn't like this at all)MICKEY'S MAGIQUE SHOWTotally worth it. It's a live 1 2 hour show that takes in lots of Disney favourites such as The Lion King and Frozen. It's a bit like seeing 6 West End shows in 1 2 an hour. It says on the guide that you should get there 20 minutes before but it's more like 40   we got there then and we were one of the last ones let in. It doesn't matter where you sit in the theatre (but the way some patrons acted in order to get seats tells you a lot about how people can lose themselves in certain circumstances). We were at the back and had a great time. ARMAGEDDON SPECIAL EFFECTSEssentially a long winded affair where you end up being in a circular room where things explode and flames shoot out of the ceiling. OK but not worth queueing for hours for.TRAM TOURGood fun. You get taken to a 'back lot' set for a movie where you see lots of special effects. I wont spoil it by telling you what but it's very impressive (but only really worth doing once)RATATOUILLE By far and away my favourite ride of all the rides at both parks. It puts you in the place of a rat in a restaurant and does a great job of really making you feel tiny   we did this one 3 times. The queues can get big but it does move quickly. It's not at all scary and a great family ride.FAST PASS   How best to use itFast Pass is an excellent system. Basically you use your ticket to scan a fast pass booth next to the ride and this gives you a time slot to come back at. You then return at this time and get on the ride within 5 minutes as you take a different queue. Be aware that fast pass can sell out very quickly for the popular rides so it's worth planning getting these tickets into your day. We used it to get repeat rides on our favourites. It makes you feel great moving past all the queues (equally you look enviously on Fast Passers when you're in the real queue!).PARK EXHAUSTIONOK. This is really worth considering. My wife's fitbit registered us as clocking up about 20k in an average day. This is a lot (especially for little ones) so you should consider breaking your day accordingly.Because of the magic hour we always arrived at 08:30 but then bailed at around 14:00 when the park became mega busy. If you're in Davey Crockett and still have access to Park Natural go swimming at the aqua centre. This worked out brilliantly for us as it gave the kids a break and got us off our feet. We then had an early dinner and returned to the park for about 18:00 when many day visitors and coaches were leaving.I guess if you're in one of the catered hotels you could do the same with the hotel pool (but I can't comment as I wasn't there).Apart from the night where we saw the castle illuminations we would then leave at about 21:00 as this allowed us to avoid the big queues.FINAL THOUGHTSWas it worth it? Totally. Yes, it's really expensive but our kids had the time of their lives and I took memories back that will stay with me forever. The parks are beautifully maintained and I can't say I had a really negative thing to say about them. We came on Monday and left on Saturday. We had 3 hours in the park on Saturday morning and it was clearly much much busier than mid week (to the point where it was hard to negotiate the number of people around you). So if you've not booked yet it'd be worthwhile avoiding the weekend if at all possible.Oh, and next time   we'll book the Sleeping Beauty suite at the main hotel   it overlooks the main street in the park and has a grand piano   the site doesn't even give you a price for it (you have to phone). I guess I'll get saving now : )I've probably missed lots of stuff but I'm sure you can pick that up from other posts.Hope your trip will be as good as ours!\""

       "[\"We booked tickets on line for Disneyland, this is something I recommend, the lines were already long when we got there, so booking your tickets in advance does help.I was advised to buy a fast passes, but i decided not to, because it was not clear to me on the website if this also counted as an entrance ticket, meaning; a total price of 90 euro with entrancevinstead or 74 or 68 or an extra 90 euro's, depending on age of child.But even if we would have, the lines were long there as well, and also, what kind of system is this? People that do not have that much to spend will be held back, because people with money obviously can skip the lines.absolutely ridiculous.Getting something to eat was horrible, again lines everywhere.just to eat someting right.And don't get me started on the staff, trying to figure out the amount of 3 icecreams with a small casio computer, and not being able to, or very rude staff. Only 2 ladies were friendly, have to be honest. All in all, very disappointing, long waiting lines, not being able to sit somewhere like a human being, and bad service.Our kids were so disappointed that they wanted to leave.We even heard people saying: 'Never again'.Absolutely not worth the money.\",\n",
       " \"We went to Disneyland Paris during the Easter break with family members who had come over from the States. As we had all experience Disneyland in Anaheim and Disneyworld in Orlando, perhaps our expectations were just too high. First off, the moving sidewalks from the parking lot to the park entrance were broken. Not a great first impression. Furthermore, there was a lot of gardening work ongoing when we arrived. Isn't Disney supposed to be magic, with everything looking in top shape and perfect? The security line moved, but was the first bottleneck. The second major bottleneck was to actually enter the park. As we had bought tickets online, we thought we would be able to enter the park fairly easily. However, there was pretty much mass chaos at the ticket check point, with many people jumping the queue and others just standing around. We eventually made it through and made our way to Fantasyland.We managed to ride a few rides, but when it came time to get on the Teacups, they had closed the ride. Not for the day, but for about 45 minutes to disperse the line. This caused many people just to loiter around the entrance, waiting for the ride to open again. Not great. We did manage to eat lunch  early  enough that we didn't have to wait a long time. However, the food that we got was not what we ordered. None of us had the wherewithal to go back and try to fix the order. so we just ate what we got. When it came time for ice cream, it took about 45 minutes just to get to the front of the line, and then another 10 minutes to process the order. This was because the staff at the counter were poorly trained, and only one person knew how to use the register, and others seemed like trainees. There were plenty of other foodcarts around the park that were empty. Not enough staff at the park to operate these. There were also plenty of rides (like Autopia and Dumbo) that were closed for renovation. Disneyland Paris does not carry the iconic felt mouse ears. We definitely won't be going back, and I can't recommend Disneyland Paris to anyone who is looking for a true Disney experience.\"]"

      "Its a shame this park carry the name Disney. They build the place years back and they are now just collecting cash without any effort, it does not compare in anything with the American parks which are truly amazing. The whole park now is designed to get money from their guests on every step without offering any services. The staff are truly miserable and seems like they hate their job. In the whole park there were no characters walking around at all so a kid can take a picture. There were 3 characters who a kid could meet in the whole park but you had to wait forever just to take a picture. Many rides where closed and the wait time for anything was 60 minutes or more, who in the world can make a a kid stand still in a waiting line for 60 Minutes or more? Avoid at all costs especially if you have young children. PS. Parking is    30 to park 30 minutes walk from the entrance after spending    75 person for your ticket.just ridiculous \n",
      "I know Disneyland is a money machine but hadn   t realised how much service and enjoyment had been sacrificed to achieve this aim. We visited with our 2 grandchildren and entered the park just after the gates opened. Even then it was manic, probably too many people for the park to cope with. The story was Q,Q and Q. The worst was Peter Pan, the board outside said a 100 minute wait but this became an actual 127 minutes! The reason for this is Fast Pass. As a day visitor you are a third class customer. The pecking order starts with those who are on special deals in the resort hotels, then comes those who have paid even more money for Fast Pass. These people are able to queue jump leaving you to watch as they go to the front of the line. The Q situation extended to the catering facilities, even a coffee took 42 minutes. The guy was morose, monosyllabic and unhelpful. There were a number of these    solo    food stations around the site and all seemed to have the same issues. Having visited Disney in California a few years back and loved the experience, Paris was an awful, poor value experience and will not be repeated.\n",
      "Visited the Park today   20 4   and can conclude that they simply let too many people in. Already at opening, queues at the attractions where 1 hour plus. At midday   the so called fast track was at 4 hours plus waiting time. And the food? Ofcourse also here endless queues and the menu still consists of pre made sad deep fried varieties of unhealthy fast food. Coffee? Don   t. They only offer a poor variety of freeze dried machine coffee. \n"
